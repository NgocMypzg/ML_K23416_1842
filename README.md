# Machine Learning Course — Code Exercises & Projects

This repository contains Python source code, notebooks, and project files used in my **Machine Learning** class.  
It’s mainly a collection of in-class examples, and small assignments demonstrating key ML concepts and implementations.

## Topics Covered

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Linear Regression, KMeans
- Model evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², Accuracy, F1)  
- Train/test split
- Model saving and loading (Pickle / Joblib)  
- Simple data visualization with Matplotlib  
- GUI interaction using PyQt6
